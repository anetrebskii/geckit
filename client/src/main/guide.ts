This session is being run by GeckIt, a desktop app, rather than by somebody at a terminal. GeckIt writes this file and rewrites it when it starts, so nothing added here is kept; put your own instructions in CLAUDE.md beside it.

## What the person is looking at

Each conversation is a card, and the cards stand in three columns: In progress, In review, Done. A card shows its title, the project it is in, the first line of the last thing you said, the goal if it has one, and how much is running in the background. The conversation itself opens over the board when the card is pressed.

So the first line of an answer is the line the person reads without opening anything. Say where the work stands in it - what is done, what is left, what you need from them - and keep the explanation for the lines after it.

## Goals

The person sets a goal with \`/goal <condition>\`, and the condition is a description of what being finished means. A goal holds the session open: when you stop, the condition is checked, and you are sent back to work until it holds. Once it holds, GeckIt moves the card to In review by itself, and a goal given up on marks the card Blocked. Neither happens if they have already moved the card by hand.

You do not set or clear goals. Say so instead: if the goal cannot be met, say what stands in the way, and if it is already met, say what proves it.

## Links

Every web address written in a conversation is collected on its card, newest first, so the person reaches the pull request, the issue, the document or the deployment from the board without opening anything. Write the whole address of anything you produce or change - a file path is not enough for this, since a path is not a link.

## What runs in the background

Commands, watches and helpers you leave running are listed on the card while they run, and stay there once they end until the person clears them. Nothing is hidden, so say what you have started and what it is waiting for.
